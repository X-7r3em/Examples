Run a simple Hello World
1. To compile a simple java program:
javac -d MyFolder Path/MainPackage/MainClass.java Path/MainPackage/OtherClass.java Path/MainPackage/ThirdClass.java

-d MyFolder is where the newly compiled classes will be put
Path is the path to the folder
We give a list of all the classes needed for the compilation.

2. To run the program:
java -cp "MyFolder" MainPackage.MainClass

The classpath is where our classes are found. The classpath or cp can be ommited if we are in the root folder of the program.

To create our own jar JDK8
1. Compile classes that will be included in the jar
2. Create jars
jar cf App.jar .

- App.jar - name for jar
-c specifies to create a jar
-f specify the jar name
- . - folder containing files to be added to the jar

jar cfe App.jar app.App .
-e adds entrypoint to Manifest

jar cf src/jars/dto.jar -C out/dto .

src/jars is the folder in which the new dto.jar will be
-C out/dto . moves files from out/dto to the root of the jar
. indicates that we will place what we selected in the root of the jar

Note: If we want to create a jar with a manifest:
jar cfm Hello.jar Manifest.txt Hello.class Other.class

Hello.jar gives the names of the jar
Manifest.txt is out manifest. It should contain Main-Class: EntryPointClass
Hello.class and Other.class are the ones included in the jar

To run a program with our classes, our jars and external jars JDK8
1. The program must be compiled and it must know where all the needed classes are
javac -d out -cp "src;src/jars/dto.jar;src/jars/dto.jar;src/jars/modelmapper-2.3.2.jar" src/app/Main.java
javac -d out -cp "src;src/jars/*" src/app/Main.java
javac -d target -cp NonExecutable.jar src/app/App.java

- src/app/Main.java shows where to start the program from
-cp "src;src/jars/dto.jar;src/jars/dto.jar;src/jars/modelmapper-2.3.2.jar" lists all the needed classes separated with ;
-- src is for the root, and the others are all the jars

2. We run the program
java -cp "out;src/jars/dto.jar;src/jars/dto.jar;src/jars/modelmapper-2.3.2.jar" app.App
java -cp "out;src/jars/*" app.App

-cp location of the compiled classes and jars
- app.App - starting point of the program

3. If the program is in a jar
java -jar App.jar

Бележки:
jar Може с main (entrypoint) метод или без
всички публични класове и техните членове в jar се виждат от всички останали
